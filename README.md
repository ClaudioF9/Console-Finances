# Console-Finances

## Description
This is the fourth challenge in my bootcamp on front-end web development. In this challenge I created code for analysing teh financial records of a company.

The instruction were as follows:

1. Create a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances. Then, clone it to your computer.
2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
    -The total number of months included in the dataset.
    -The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
    -The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
       -You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
        (Total/Number of months)
    -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
    -The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.
